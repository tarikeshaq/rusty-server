# Rusty Server

A low level web server accompanied with a simple thread pool that serves simple html pages on get reqeusts
## Why

Built this while finishing up the Rust Book, felt it's cool to build a web server 
this low level so it's up here :) The Rust book is amazing and gracefully introduced
me to ownership/borrowing
